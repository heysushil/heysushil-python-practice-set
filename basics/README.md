# BASIC PYTHON PROGRAM EXCERSIES LIST WITH SOLUTION

## You get the solution at [Solution Page](https://github.com/heysushil/python-practice-set/blob/master/solutions/python_basic_excercise.md)

## Following Python Programming Questions List:

1. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


2. Exercise 2 (and Solution)
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)


3. Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
