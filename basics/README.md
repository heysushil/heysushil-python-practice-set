# BASIC PYTHON PROGRAM EXCERSIES LIST WITH SOLUTION

### You get the solution at [Solution Page](https://github.com/heysushil/python-practice-set/blob/master/solutions/python_basic_excercise.md)


1. Exercise 1 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)


2. Exercise 2 (and Solution)
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
